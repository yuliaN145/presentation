					<h1>OWASP TOP 10</h1>
					<p>by YuliaN145</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section><h2>What is OWASP?</h2></section>
					<section>
						Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit 
						organization that aims to improve software security. It is a one-stop 
						shop for individuals, enterprises, government agencies, and other 
						global organizations seeking failure and real-world knowledge regarding 
						application security.

						<p>
							With cybercrime on the rise, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults, 
						faulty access control, and data breaches occur frequently. The OWASP 
						Foundation developed the OWASP Top 10 to help avoid these security 
						concerns.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							OWASP’s last “Top 10” list was published in 2017, which was recently updated in Q4 of 2021.

						<h2>What Are the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities for 2022?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="./OWASP-Vulnerabilities.png" alt="">
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section><h2>1. Broken access control</h2></section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Access control implements strategies to prevent 
							users from operating beyond the scope of their 
							specified permissions. Due to access vulnerabilities, 
							unauthenticated or unwanted users may access 
							classified data and processes and user privilege settings.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section><h2>2. Cryptographic failures </h2></section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Cryptographic failures, formerly known as 
							sensitive data exposure, rose one spot to 
							position two. This is more of a symptom 
							than a primary cause; the emphasis here 
							lies on cryptographic errors or lack thereof, 
							which frequently expose sensitive data.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Typical examples of sensitive information exposure:</h3>
						<p>
							1.Session tokens <br>
							2.Login IDs and passwords<br>
							3.Online transactions<br>
							4.Personal information (switched service network or SSN, health records, etc.)<br>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							1.You should use robust, salted and adaptive hashing algorithms with a delay factor to store passwords, like scrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2 or bcrypt. <br>
							2.Older protocols such as file transfer protocol (FTP) and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) should be avoided when transferring sensitive data. <br>
							3.Instead of merely using encryption, it is advisable to implement authenticated encryption. <br>
							4.Cryptographically random keys must be produced and stored as byte arrays. If passwords are employed, it has to be changed into something like a key using an algorithm for password-based key creation. <br>
						</p>
					</section>

						<h2>
							3. Injections
						</h2>
						<img src="./What is a SQL injection.jpg" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Injection (or SQL injections) is a database attack 
							against a website that uses structured query language 
							(SQL) to obtain information or perform activities 
							that would ordinarily need an authenticated user 
							account. These codes are difficult for the program 
							to interpret from its own code, allowing attackers 
							to conduct injection attacks to gain access to 
							protected areas and sensitive data masquerading 
							as trusted users. Injections include SQL injections,
							 command injections, CRLF injections, and LDAP injections, etc.
						</p>

					<section>
						<img src="./6256fdfb247c55a0e1072b2e_Insecure Design Preview.jpg" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Insecure design is a wide category that 
							contains a variety of problems, such as 
							.”missing or inadequate control design.” 
							That does not imply that insecure design 
							is the root of all other top 10 risk categories.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						1. Set up and use a secure development lifecycle with the assistance of AppSec specialists to evaluate and build security and privacy safeguards. <br>
						2. Threat modeling is advised for crucial verification, access control, application logic, and essential flows. <br>
						3. Include security terminology and controls inside user stories. <br>
						4. Tenant segregation by design across all tiers is also seen as a practical preventative approach. <br>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>5. Security misconfigurations  </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							General security setup issues, quite like misconfigured access controls, pose 
							significant hazards by providing attackers with quick and easy access to critical data and site regions.
							To avoid configuration complications, secure installation techniques must be used
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							6. Vulnerable and outdated components 
						</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							The majority of online apps are created with the help 
							of third-party frameworks. Unknown application codes 
							may result in undesirable outcomes and unwanted situations
							 such as accent control violations, SQL injections, etc. 
							 If the program is insecure, unsupported, or outdated, 
							 there may be vulnerability-related hazards
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>7. Identification and authentication failures </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							When an attacker obtains user information, password recovery, 
							ID sessions, and other login credentials, it poses security issues.  
							As the name implies, an identity and authentication failure 
							includes hackers exploiting such vulnerabilities to take advantage 
							of inadequate authentication.

					<section>
						<h2>8. Software and data integrity failures</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							This is a new category, and it focuses on assuming the integrity 
							of software updates, vital data, and CI/CD procedures without 
							verifying them. One example is when applications use extensions, 
							modules, or repositories from content delivery networks (CDNs) 
							or unauthorized sources. A continuous integration/continuous delivery 
							(CI/CD) process that is not protected might raise the risk of malicious 
							code, system compromise or unauthorized access.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>9. Security logging and monitoring failures </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							1.Verify that all authentication, access security systems, and server-side data validation problems are recorded with sufficient user information to detect suspicious or fraudulent accounts and stored for an adequate period to a delayed comprehensive investigation. <br>
							2.Make sure that logs are created in formats consumable by log management systems.<br>
							3.Ensure that log data is encoded appropriately to avoid intrusions or cyber threats to the monitoring systems. <br>
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>10. Server-side request forgery (SSRF) </h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
						1. To limit the effects of SSRF, one should separate remote resource access functions into distinct networks. <br>
						2. Install “deny by default” firewall settings or network access control rules for blocking all web traffic except for required internal traffic. <br>
						3. To protect against attacks like DNS remapping and “time of check, time of usage,” in (TOCTOU) situations, it’s good to be conscious of URL accuracy. <br>
